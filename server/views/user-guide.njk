      <p class="govuk-body">Prepare a case for sentence is a digital service that helps probation practitioners and
        court administrators prepare for cases in magistrates’ courts.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The service gives an overview of defendants appearing in a court, including:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>what they've been charged with</li>
        <li>their probation status</li>
        <li>their NDelius probation record including information on current and previous orders</li>
        <li>risk information</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">By automatically matching defendants to probation records and displaying key information, the service saves time and effort for probation practitioners and court administrators as they prepare for cases in advance and on the day.

        records</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Some defendants may have 'Possible NDelius record' as their probation status.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">This happens when the service has found one or more records that match the defendant's
        details.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You need to review the records that have been found and select the correct record.
        This will update the case with the defendant's probation status and NDelius record information.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-reviewing-possible-records">Reviewing possible records</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">There are two ways to review possible records for a defendant. You can either go to the case
        of the defendant or use the 'Review defendants with possible records' link above the case list.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">When you 'Review records' you will be able to see and compare the defendant's details from
        Libra (name, date of birth, address and PNC) to the details of the possible NDelius records.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Check if any of the records match the defendant. If a record matches the defendant, select
        it and 'Confirm record'.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-duplicate-records">Duplicate records</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">If the defendant has duplicate NDelius records, you should select one of the records to link
        to that defendant for the case.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should make a note of the duplicate CRN and follow your existing processes for flagging duplicate NDelius records.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If none of the possible records match the defendant , click 'Can't see the correct record?'
        to either confirm the defendant does not have a probation record or to link them to a different record using an
        NDelius case reference number.</p>

        records</h2>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-link-a-record-to-a-defendant">Link a record to a defendant</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">If a defendant displays as 'No record' but you are aware they are known to probation, you
        can link an NDelius record to them with a case reference number (CRN).</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">To link a record you need to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>go to the case and 'Link NDelius record'</li>
        <li>enter the case reference number of the NDelius record</li>
        <li>'Find record' to see details of the record</li>
        <li>check the details are correct and then 'Link record to defendant'</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">When you link a record to a defendant, the case will update to show the defendant's new
        probation status, and display their probation record and risk register information.

      <p class="govuk-body">If a defendant has been linked to the wrong NDelius record, you can unlink the record.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">To unlink a record you need to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>go to the case and 'Unlink NDelius record'</li>
        <li>check the details of the linked record and then 'Unlink record from defendant'</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">When you unlink a record from a defendant, the case will update to show the defendant as 'No
        record' and give you the option to link a different record.</p>
