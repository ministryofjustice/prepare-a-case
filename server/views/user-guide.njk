      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="ug-overview">Overview</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Prepare a case for sentence is a digital service that helps probation practitioners and
        court administrators prepare for cases in magistratesâ€™ courts.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The service gives an overview of defendants appearing in a court, including:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>their probation status</li>
        <li>their probation record including information on current and previous orders</li>
        <li>risk information</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">By providing this information in a more accessible format, staff can prepare for court more
        effectively and provide better advice with less effort.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Select a court to see case lists in that court.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you need to view a different court, click 'Change Court' at the top of the page to return
        to the list of courts.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="ug-viewing-a-case-list">Viewing a case list</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">The case list will show all cases due to be heard in a court on a particular day.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-what-you-can-see-on-the-case-list">What you can see on the case list</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">For each case you can see:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>defendant's name</li>
        <li>their probation status</li>
        <li>the offence they are appearing for</li>
        <li>case listing number, courtroom and session</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">Defendants can have one of three probation statuses:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><strong class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Current</strong> - the defendant has a probation record and an
          order that they are currently subject to
        </li>
        <li><strong class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Previously known</strong> - the defendant has a probation record
          but are not supervised by probation currently
        </li>
        <li><strong class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">No record</strong> - no probation record could be found that
          matches the name, date of birth or PNC number of the defendant
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">If a defendant has a 'Possible NDelius record', you need to review the details of the
        possible record and confirm their probation status.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-applying-filters-to-a-case-list">Applying filters to a case list</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can filter a case list by probation status, courtroom and session. You can apply
        multiple filters to a case list.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">When filters are applied, the case list will only display cases that match the selected
        filters.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can remove filters individually or all at once by selecting 'Clear all'.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-viewing-case-lists-on-other-days">Viewing case lists on other days</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will always see the case list for 'Today' when you sign in and select a court to
        view.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The service allows you to see 7 working days ahead and displays these dates above the case
        list. Select a date to jump to the case list for that day.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-updates-to-a-case-list">Updates to a case list</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">A case list appears 7 days in advance of the cases being heard and is updated with new cases
        3 times over the course of a week.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The first update is received 48 hours before the cases are due to be heard.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The second update is received on the day of the case list at 8:45am. The third update is
        received at 9:45am.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can see when a case list was last updated by looking at the time above the case list. It
        will also show when the list will next be updated.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Example</strong></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Wednesday 6 June: Case list for Wednesday 13 June appears in the service.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Update 1 - Monday 11 June at 12:00am: Case list for Wednesday 13 June updates with 6 new

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-recently-added-cases">Recently added cases</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">When viewing the case list for 'Today' after 8:45am or 9:45am, a 'Recently added' tab will
        appear on the case list.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This tab will display any cases that have been added to the list that morning i.e remand or
        other overnight cases.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">These cases also appear on the full case list.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">On each case you will see the defendant's name, PNC number, their probation status and a
        case reference number (CRN) if they have an NDelius record.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Depending on whether the defendant has a probation record or not, there will also be the

        records</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Some defendants may have 'Possible NDelius record' as their probation status on a case
        list.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">This happens when the service has either found multiple records that match the defendant's
        details or one record that partially matches the defendant.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You need to review the records that have been found and select the correct record to confirm
        the defendant's probation status.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-reviewing-possible-records">Reviewing possible records</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">There are two ways to review possible records for a defendant. You can either go to the case
        of the defendant or use the 'Review defendants with possible records' link above the case list.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">When you 'Review records' you will be able to see and compare the defendant's details from
        Libra (name, date of birth, address and PNC) to the details of the possible NDelius records.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Check if any of the records match the defendant. If a record matches the defendant, select
        it and 'Confirm record'.</p>

      <h4 class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Duplicate records</h4>

      <p class="govuk-body">If the defendant has duplicate NDelius records, you should select 1 of the records to link
        to that defendant for the case and follow your existing processes for flagging duplicate records to the IT
        team.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If none of the possible records are the defendant</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If none of the possible records match the defendant , click 'Can't see the correct record?'
        to either confirm the defendant does not have a probation record or to link them to a different record using an
        NDelius case reference number.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-link-a-record-to-a-defendant">Link a record to a defendant</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">If a defendant displays as 'No record' but you are aware they are known to probation, you
        can link an NDelius record to them with a case reference number (CRN).</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">To link a record you need to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>go to the case and 'Link NDelius record'</li>
        <li>enter the case reference number of the NDelius record</li>

        <li>check the details are correct and then 'Link record to defendant'</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">When you link a record to a defendant, the case will update to show the defendant's new

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="ug-unlink-a-record-from-a-defendant">Unlink a record from a defendant</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">If a defendant has been linked to the wrong NDelius record, you can unlink the record.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">To unlink a record you need to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>go to the case and 'Unlink NDelius record'</li>
        <li>check the details of the linked record and then 'Unlink record from defendant'</li>

      <p class="govuk-body">When you unlink a record from a defendant, the case will update to show the defendant as 'No
